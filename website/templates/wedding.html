<h1><span>Friday, August 19th, 2016</span></h1>
<p>If you are in Seattle on Friday evening, Brett and Jen will be serving
cocktails at their home in Seattle's Central District from 8&ndash;10:30
p.m.</p>

<h1><span>Saturday, August 20th, 2016</span></h1>
<p>Join us at 5:30 p.m. at Meadowbrook Farm in North Bend as we begin
our marriage. The ceremony will be outdoors, and the indoor/outdoor reception
will follow immediately afterwards at the same location. There is plenty of
parking at the venue, but if you're coming from out of town and would like us
to help you find a carpool to or from the wedding, please let us know.</p>

<h1><span>Sunday, August 21st, 2016</span></h1>
<p>We know weddings, though joyous affairs, don't always leave much time for
socializing with the bride and groom. In order to spend more time with our
family and family friends who have travelled to Seattle, we will be hosting a
light brunch at our home from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
