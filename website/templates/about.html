<p>Jen&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Professor of Mathematics at Bellevue College. She teaches a
range of courses from introductory algebra to differential equations and
linear algebra. When she's not at work or grading, Jen spends her time hiking,
cooking delicious vegetarian food, reading, and being crafty in both senses of the word.</p>

<p>Brett is a Senior Software Engineer at Google. He works on Offline Maps,
which enable search and turn-by-turn directions in Google Maps for Android and
iOS even when there's no internet access. Brett spends his free time playing
video games, eating delicious vegetarian food, cycling, reading, and hiking.</p>

<p>Brett and Jen met at college in Claremont, CA, but they didn't start dating
until they both moved to Seattle in 2013. At that point they realized they'd grown independently into people who work remarkably well together.  Two years later, they got engaged
during a 200 mile cycling tour of the Oregon coast and its brewpubs.</p>
